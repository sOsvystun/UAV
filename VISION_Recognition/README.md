# VISION Recognition

This directory contains the C++ computer vision module for defect detection.

### Purpose
- Processes multispectral (RGB + IR) images from the UAV.
- Uses an ensemble of YOLOv8 and Cascade R-CNN models to detect defects on wind turbine blades.
- Provides the core defect detection capabilities for the system.

For more information on the overall project architecture and build instructions, please see the [main project README](../../README.md).
