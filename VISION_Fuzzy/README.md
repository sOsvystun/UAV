# VISION Fuzzy

This directory contains the Python-based fuzzy logic system for defect criticality assessment.

### Purpose
- Implements a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) using `scikit-fuzzy`.
- Evaluates the severity of detected defects based on size, location, and thermal signature.
- Provides a criticality score to help prioritize maintenance.

For more information on the overall project architecture and build instructions, please see the [main project README](../../README.md).
