# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks identified in the UAV Wind-Turbine Inspection Suite. The system currently suffers from command injection vulnerabilities, path traversal issues, insecure deserialization, and significant inference performance limitations. This feature will implement comprehensive security hardening measures while optimizing the inference pipeline for production-grade performance and scalability.

The implementation will transform the current vulnerable system into a secure, high-performance platform suitable for enterprise deployment with proper authentication, authorization, input validation, and optimized inference capabilities.
